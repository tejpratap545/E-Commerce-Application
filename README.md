## Frameworks we used

1. For Backend - [Django](https://github.com/django/django)

   Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development

2. For Frontend - [Nuxt js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js)

   Nuxt is a progressive framework based on Vue.js to create modern web applications. It is based on Vue.js official libraries (vue, vue-router and vuex) and powerful development tools (webpack, Babel and PostCSS). Nuxt's goal is to make web development powerful and performant with a great developer experience in mind.
3. For Documentation - [Vuepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress)
